# OnTime

This project was made with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

### Why I Made This

I am currently moving to a new area and apartment, and I wanted to be able to stay organized while I moved. You can record notes with an integrated editor. There is a bills page where you can record your monthly bills which will reset each month. There is also a calendar where you can write down miscellaneous
things.
